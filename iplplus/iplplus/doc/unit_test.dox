/*! @page unit_tests Unit Testing
 *
 * If the  framework @c cppunit can  be detected during  the configuration step,
 * the  buildsystem  creates a  target  <tt>test</tt>.  This  target starts  the
 * regression test and executes all registered unit tests. Changes in the source
 * code must not be released until all regression tests pass.
 *
 * The result of  all tests are written  to a xml file. The  build server parses
 * this files and generates a report. To output the test results directly to the
 * console  on the  developers machine,  you must  set the  environment variable
 * <tt>CSS_LOCAL_TESTING</tt>, so locally use
 * @code
 *     fesc@viper10:~/projekte/buildcss/release/iplplus$ CSS_LOCAL_TESTING=ON ctest
 * @endcode
 *
 * The whole  testing suite can  also be run  after installing. When  testing is
 * enabled a  testing package  is built during  packaging. After  installing the
 * software and the  test-package, ones can run the  tests against the installed
 * library.   But  this   requires  that   the  tests   are   configured  during
 * runtime. There are several environment variables to control this
 * - @c IPL_TESTIMAGE_PATH path to the directory with the test images, normally
 *      @c <install-prefix>/var/ipl/images.
 * - @c IPL_TESTDATA_PATH path to test data, normally
        @c <install-prefix>/var/ipl/testdata.
 * - @c IPL_TEST_LOGFILE the configuration file for the logger
 *
 * @cond developer_docu
 *
 * @section new_test_cases Setting up New Tests
 *
 * All  tests are  located  in the  directory  @c tests  and  are prefixed  with
 * <tt>test_</tt>. The build system relies on this prefix, so don't change it.
 *
 * To add  a new test suite,  copy a existing one  and adapt it.  The test class
 * normally has the  name @c TestClass with  the name of the class  to be tested
 * instead of @c Class.
 *
 * If  a class  in  the library  is  extended by  a new  method  or an  optional
 * parameter, extend the test cases too. Write the test first, before coding the
 * feature.
 *
 * To compile and enable the test suite,  ones must register the new test in the
 * file     <tt>tests/CMakeLists.txt</tt>      by     extending     the     list
 * <em>TESTS_TO_RUN</em>.
